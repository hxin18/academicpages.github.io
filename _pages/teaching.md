My current research is mainly focused on information diffusion in social network. 
Previously I worked on developing topic-based methods for academic search and recommendation and visualzation of topic evolution, which are the theoretical part of our [Academic Search Engine](https://acemap.sjtu.edu.cn).

I am also interested in other machine learning related topics (eg. deep learning), data mining, espically graph mining and text mining.
