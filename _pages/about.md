I am a second year master student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am a research assistant at the <a href="http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn" target="_blank",rel="nofollow">Intelligent Internet of Things(IIoT) of SJTU</a>, and I am working under the guidance of <a href="http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/Personal/xwang8/index.html" target="_blank",rel="nofollow">Prof. Xinbing Wang</a> now. </p>
Before that, I got my bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2016.
