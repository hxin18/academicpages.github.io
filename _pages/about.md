I am a master student in Computer Science in University of Southern California in 2018. Before that, I got my bachelor degree in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2016. 

During my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant at the Intelligent Internet of Things([IIoT](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn)) of SJTU and I am working under the guidance of [Prof. Xinbing Wang](http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/Personal/xwang8/index.html). 

On 2019 Summer, I am fortunate to work as a software engineer intern at Hulu. #We are all hulugan!

I am looking for entry level software engineer starting at 2020 January.
