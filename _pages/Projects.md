Smart Home System using Rasperry Pi
============
In this project, we design prototype of a smart home system based on Raspburry Pi. We make full use of sensors to measure multiple environmental parameters and based on these parameters we can turn on or turn off the electrical devices like light or alarming system automatically. Moreover, we combine the data-mining techniques into the prediction part of our system, making our system more intelligent.

Link Prediction using Textual and Graphical Features
============
In this project,we mainly focus on link prediction on the scholarly data. The dataset contains citation networks of 27770 documents with the information of title, abstract, authors and publish time. The intuition of the feature extraction is to simulate the way the scholar do when adding the citations to their academic works. Generally, when an author sellect the documents that he wants to cite, there are multiple factors to consider: the correspondance of textual content, the statue of cited documents in the citation network, etc. In the following sections, we will give a concrete description about the features that we select.
